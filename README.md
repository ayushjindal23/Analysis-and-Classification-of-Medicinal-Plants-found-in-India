# Analysis-and-Classification-of-Medicinal-Plants-found-in-India
Ayurveda, the traditional medicinal system of India, suggests using various plant parts such as leaves, roots, fruits, and stems to cure a variety of ailments. Indian plants and herbs have been studied for their potential as medicines by numerous academics in the west. Due to this the recognition of these plants has become a focus of ongoing research. For the goal of classification and identification, this research employs an appropriate machine learning approach. Preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification are the three main stages of the proposed methodology. Standard image processing operations such as grayscale conversion and border improvement are performed during the preprocessing phase. The feature extraction phase gaps were closed using Closing operation of Morphological Transformation. The main innovation in this research is the use of Random Forest algorithm for classification of 29 plant species which are naturally occurring and readily available in India for their medicinal purpose
